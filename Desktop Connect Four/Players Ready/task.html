<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, we will finalize our game to play it with a friend! For this, we need to come up with an algorithm to check if a player has connected four pieces in a row after every click. The check must be carried out in three directions: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. When the algorithm detects a winning move, the program should highlight these four cells so that the players can easily see who's won.</p>
<p>We will also add the baseline background color for the cells from the start of the game and a distinct color for the cells that form a win condition. You can choose any colors that you want as long as the baseline and winning colors are different.</p>
<p>Ensure that your program processes invalid moves in the following way. A click on a filled column should do nothing, and the player must be given another try. Additionally, a click on any cell after a game has been finished should lead to nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, don't forget to add the reset button!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, implement the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the baseline color for all cells at the start of the application;</li>
<li>Add a reset button that extends the <code class="java">JButton</code> named <code class="java">ButtonReset</code>. The button should be enabled. Clicking on it should clear all cells and return them to their baseline color;</li>
<li>Check if either player has connected four in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally after each move;</li>
<li>Once a winner has been detected, change the color of the four winning cells to the winning color. The baseline color and the winning color should be two different colors;</li>
<li>A click on any board cell in any filled column must lead to nothing. The gameplay continues with the same player's turn;</li>
<li>A click on any board cell once a game is finished must lead to nothing.</li>
</ol>
